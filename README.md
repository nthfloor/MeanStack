## MEAN Stack Tutorial

This little project is me just playing around with the MEAN stack by adding new and different features as needed.

For the moment I am focusing on the following features:
    1. Authentication
    2. CRUD functionality using MongoDB
    3. Allow for 3rd party auth such as Google/LinkedIn

If you have any advice or comments please don't hesitate to drop me an email.
